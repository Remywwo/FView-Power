- npm run release `<version>` command for automated releases
- Markdown engine migrated from react-markdown to markdown-it
- local image paths in Markdown now resolve via Tauri `convertFileSrc` (asset://)

### Changed
- Cargo binary renamed from `fview` to `fview-power` (macOS Dock hover now shows "FView Power")
- Tauri release CI: switched to `actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain` for consistent installs
- Release workflow: publishes directly instead of draft
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` versions now in sync

### Fixed
- Windows build: Tauri permissions for `mkdir`, `remove`, `rename` added to capabilities

- with-path.mjs: use `spawnSync` to locate cargo (works on Windows GitHub Actions runner)
- Auto-update workflow trigger: switched from `release:published` to `workflow_run`
